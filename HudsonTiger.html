                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>The task that your team has to perform is really big and requires research. In short, you all have to develop a Chatbot and AI and for these firstly you have to research and start developing dummies as you pass different stages of learning. Next, you all know that AI is changing every day so it requires updates on a regular basis. The UI of the Chatbot should be basic and doesn't include attractive colors and the developed software for the Chatbot should be fully interactive for any type of user and could answer real-time problems. Wish you ALL THE BEST for the success of this task.</p>
